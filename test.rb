# Field Validation and Filtering Challenge
#
# Implement a filtering mechanism for user input that cleans free-form text fields.
# Users can enter letters, numbers, and other characters, but only specific allowed
# characters should remain in the output.
#
# Rules:
# - Only letters from allowed_letters array should remain
# - Only numbers from allowed_numbers array should remain
# - Valid numbers must be reordered in increasing order at their numeric positions
# - Letter positions remain unchanged
# - Return empty string for null/empty input
# - Do not modify the input arrays
#
# @param input [String] The input string to filter
# @param allowed_letters [Array<String>] Array of allowed letter characters
# @param allowed_numbers [Array<String>] Array of allowed numeric characters
# @return [String] The filtered string with letters preserved and numbers sorted

def field_validation_and_filtering(input, allowed_letters, allowed_numbers)
  result = []
