"""
Field Validation and Filtering Challenge

Implement a filtering mechanism for user input that cleans free-form text fields.
Users can enter letters, numbers, and other characters, but only specific allowed
characters should remain in the output.

Rules:
- Only letters from allowed_letters list should remain
- Only numbers from allowed_numbers list should remain
- Valid numbers must be reordered in increasing order at their numeric positions
- Letter positions remain unchanged
- Return empty string for null/empty input
- Do not modify the input arrays

Args:
    input_str (str): The input string to filter
    allowed_letters (list): List of allowed letter characters
    allowed_numbers (list): List of allowed numeric characters

Returns:
    str: The filtered string with letters preserved and numbers sorted
